# instagramclone
A project replicating Instagram's core functionalities using React.js and Firebase. Features include user authentication, photo sharing, and social interactions.

I am currently working on my first project, an Instagram clone. This project aims to replicate some of the core functionalities of the popular social media platform Instagram. To guide me through the development process, I am following along with a tutorial [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMScMwY2B6Q). The project is being developed using JSX for the frontend components and Firebase for backend functionalities such as authentication, storage, and database management. Through this project, I am gaining hands-on experience in web development, learning about frontend frameworks like React, and exploring backend solutions using cloud services like Firebase.
